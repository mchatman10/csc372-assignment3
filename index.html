    <aside>Deciding between 3 different restaurants can be very tough! My personal
        pick out of the 3? Easily Raaz Indian Kitchen. I'm a sucker for some good Indian
        cuisine, and the tikka misala hits the spot, every time. Another dish from Raaz that
        went unmentioned in this blog is the butter chicken. I highly recommend it, and it goes
        especially well with the garlic naan.
